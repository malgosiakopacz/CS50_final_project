        <h4>BMI (Body Mass Index)</h4>
        <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation used to assess whether a person’s weight is in a healthy range relative to their height. It’s calculated by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters (kg/m²). BMI is a quick and widely-used tool for identifying whether someone <strong>might be</strong> underweight, at a healthy weight, overweight, or obese, which can help in evaluating potential health risks. However, BMI doesn’t directly measure body fat, so it’s often used alongside other assessments for a fuller picture of an individual’s health.</p>

        <h5>Limitations of BMI</h5>
        <p>While BMI is a useful tool for estimating healthy weight ranges, it has several limitations. Because it only considers weight and height, BMI does not account for individual differences in muscle mass, bone density, or body composition. For example:</p>
        <ol class="inside">
            <ul>Athletes or muscular individuals may have higher BMIs without having excess body fat.</ul>
            <ul>Older adults with lower muscle mass may have a normal BMI but higher body fat levels.</ul>
        </ol>
        <p>As a result, BMI should be considered in conjuction with other measures, such as body fat percentage, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of an individual’s health.</p>

        <h4>Body Fat</h4>
        <p>Body fat refers to the amount of fat stored in the body as a percentage of total body weight. It plays essential roles, including energy storage, organ protection, and temperature regulation.</p>
        <p>However, having too much or too little body fat can negatively impact health:</p>
        <ol class="inside">
            <ul>Excess body fat is associated with conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.</ul>
            <ul>Insufficient body fat can result in nutrient deficiencies and weakened immunity.</ul>
        </ol>
        <p>Unlike BMI, body fat measurement provides a clearer picture of health by distinguishing fat from lean mass.</p>

        <h5>Limitations of This Prediction</h5>
        <p>Our prediction model provides an estimate of body fat percentage based on patterns derived from a small group of approximately 250 men. Due to this limited dataset, the model may be less accurate for individuals with body fat levels that are either very high or very low.</p>
        <ol class="inside">
            <ul>For very lean individuals, the model might overestimate their body fat levels.</ul>
            <ul>For those with higher body fat, it may underestimate.</ul>
        </ol>
        <p>Think of this estimate as a baseline rather than an exact measure, especially if you fall outside the typical range. To gain more accurate understanding of your body fat, consider combining this estimate with other assessments or professional measurements.</p>
